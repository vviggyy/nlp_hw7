British/N Airways/N said/V its/P shareholders/N accepted/V only/R 6.3/J %/N of/I the/D convertible/J capital/N bonds/N ,/, but/C that/I the/D rest/N of/I the/D issue/N will/M be/V taken/V up/R by/I underwriters/N ./.

But/C except/N for/I the/D embarrassment/N ,/, British/N Air/N will/M emerge/V relatively/R unscathed/V from/I the/D flopped/J issue/N ./.

But/C British/N Air/N 's/P withdrawal/N from/I the/D UAL/N buy-out/N could/M have/V further/J repercussions/N ./.

The/D article/N is/V ,/, unfortunately/N ,/, replete/N with/I outrageous/J distortions/N ./.
One/N of/I Mr./N Roberts/N 's/P observations/N is/V that/I the/D Bank/N 's/P own/J loan/N portfolio/N is/V in/I deep/J trouble/N because/I of/I its/P lending/N to/T developing/V countries/N ./.
This/N is/V just/R not/R so/R ./.
The/D reality/N is/V that/I Bank/N finances/N are/V rock/J solid/N ./.
As/N of/I June/N 30/C ,/, 1989/N --/: the/D day/N our/P past/J fiscal/J year/N came/V to/T a/D close/N --/: only/R 4.1/J %/N of/I the/D Bank/N 's/P portfolio/N was/V affected/V by/I arrears/N of/I over/$ six/C months/N ./.
This/N is/V an/D enviably/N low/N level/N ./.
Moreover/N ,/, the/D Bank/N follows/V a/D prudent/J provisioning/N policy/N and/C has/V set/V aside/R $/$ 800/C million/C against/I possible/J loan/N losses/N ./.
For/I the/D same/J fiscal/J year/N ,/, by/I the/D way/N ,/, the/D Bank/N 's/P net/J income/N was/V a/D robust/J $/$ 1.1/C billion/C after/I provisions/N ./.
Because/N of/I the/D business-like/J manner/N in/I which/W the/D Bank/N goes/V about/I development/N ,/, financial/J markets/N have/V confidence/N in/I it/P ./.
This/D helps/N explain/V the/D triple-A/J rating/N enjoyed/N by/I our/P bonds/N and/C our/N ability/N to/T borrow/V $/$ 9.3/C billion/C in/I fiscal/J 1989/N on/I the/D most/J advantageous/N terms/N ./.
Another/N of/I Mr./N Roberts/N 's/P criticisms/N is/V that/I Bank/N lending/N has/V done/V more/J harm/N than/I good/J ``/N by/I implanting/V the/D wrong/J incentives/N and/C deflecting/N energy/N away/N from/I economic/J development/N ./. ''/'
Here/N ,/, too/R ,/, Mr./N Roberts/N is/V way/N off/I the/D mark/N ./.
The/D reality/N is/V that/I Bank/N loans/N have/V been/V linked/V to/T policy/N improvements/N for/I 40/C years/N ./.
Our/D traditional/J project/N loans/N have/V ,/, for/I instance/N ,/, supported/V sensible/J energy/N pricing/N in/I the/D power/N sector/N ,/, sound/N interest-rate/N policies/N in/I the/D credit/N area/N and/C the/D operation/N of/I public/J utilities/N as/I efficient/N ,/, autonomous/N agencies/N ./.
By/I and/C large/N ,/, these/D efforts/N have/V borne/J fruit/N ./.
In/I my/J home/N region/N ,/, Latin/N America/N ,/, much/R of/I the/D existing/J infrastructure/N base/N --/: an/D important/J building/N block/N for/I development/N --/N has/V been/V financed/V by/I the/D World/N Bank/N ./.
Mr./N Roberts/N also/R takes/V a/D swipe/N at/I the/D Bank/N 's/P adjustment/N lending/N ./.

The/D Bank/N has/V been/V making/V adjustment/N loans/N for/I 10/C years/N ./.
As/I their/P name/N implies/N ,/, these/D operations/N are/V linked/V to/T far-reaching/V policy/N reforms/N that/I aim/N at/I helping/N borrowing/N countries/N get/V back/R on/I the/D growth/N path/N and/C at/I enhancing/N their/P credit-worthiness/N ./.
Typically/N ,/, these/D measures/N include/V reforms/N to/T downsize/V the/D role/N of/I government/N and/C parastatals/N in/I the/D economy/N ,/, to/T open/V up/R inward-looking/J economies/N to/T international/J competition/N and/C to/T promote/V the/D development/N of/I a/D vigorous/J private/J sector/N ./.
Support/N for/I the/D private/J sector/N has/V been/V a/D longstanding/J concern/N of/I the/D Bank/N 's/P ./.
Over/I the/D years/N ,/, it/P has/V helped/V encourage/J investments/N by/I entrepreneurs/N in/I the/D Third/N World/N through/I its/P extensive/J credit/N operations/N and/C through/I loans/N and/C investments/N by/I the/D International/N Finance/N Corp/N ./.
Most/J recently/N ,/, the/D Bank/N Group/N has/V been/V expanded/V to/T include/V the/D Multilateral/N Investment/N Guarantee/N Agency/N to/T stimulate/V direct/V foreign/J investment/N in/I developing/N countries/N by/I offering/N guarantees/N against/I noncommercial/J risk/N and/C advice/N to/T member/N countries/N on/I how/N to/T improve/V their/P business/N climate/N ./.

Some/D atmospheric/J scientists/N think/V that/I even/N if/I CFCs/N were/V released/V into/I the/D atmosphere/N at/I an/D accelerating/J rate/N ,/, the/D amount/N of/I ozone/N depletion/N would/M be/V only/R 10/C %/N by/I the/D middle/N of/I the/D next/J century/N ./.
It/P 's/V easy/V to/T get/V something/N comparable/N by/I simply/N moving/V to/T a/D higher/J altitude/N in/I the/D U.S/N ./.
Moreover/N ,/, there/R are/V questions/N ,/, particularly/N among/I atmospheric/J scientists/N who/W know/V this/D subject/J best/N ,/, about/I the/D ability/N of/I anyone/N to/T know/V what/N in/I fact/N is/V happening/V to/T the/D ozone/N layer/N ./.
It/P is/V generally/R agreed/V that/I when/D CFCs/N rise/N from/I earth/N to/T stratosphere/N ,/, the/D chlorine/N in/I them/P is/V capable/N of/I interfering/N with/I the/D process/N through/I which/J ultraviolet/N rays/N split/N oxygen/N molecules/N and/C form/N ozone/N ./.
But/C ozone/N creation/N is/V a/D very/J large-scale/N natural/N process/N and/C the/D importance/N of/I human-generated/J CFCs/N in/I reducing/N it/P is/V largely/I a/D matter/N of/I conjecture/N ./.
The/D ozone/N layer/N is/V constantly/N in/I motion/N and/C thus/N very/R hard/V to/T measure/V ./.
What/N scientists/N have/V known/V since/I the/D late/J 1970s/N is/V that/I there/N is/V a/D hole/N in/I the/D layer/N over/I Antarctica/N that/I expands/N or/C contracts/N from/I year/N to/T year/N ./.
But/C it/P is/V at/I least/J worthy/N of/I some/D note/N that/I there/N are/V very/R few/J refrigerators/N in/I Antarctica/N ./.
Moreover/N ,/, surely/N someone/N has/V noticed/V that/I household/N refrigerators/N are/V closed/V systems/N ,/, running/V for/I many/J years/N without/I either/C the/D CFC/N gas/N or/C the/D insulation/N ever/N escaping/N ./.
Another/D argument/N of/I the/D environmentalists/N is/V that/I if/I substitutes/N are/V available/J ,/, why/V not/R use/V them/P ?/.
Mr./N Teagan/N cites/V a/D list/N of/I substitutes/N but/C none/N ,/, so/R far/R ,/, match/V the/D nonflammable/N ,/, nontoxic/N CFCs/N ./.
Butane/N and/C propane/N can/M be/V used/V as/I coolants/N ,/, for/I example/N ,/, but/C are/V flammable/N ./.

At/I Pacific/N Telesis/N Group/N ,/, flextime/N is/V left/V up/R to/T individual/V working/J groups/N ,/, because/I some/D of/I the/D telephone/N company/N 's/P employees/N must/M be/V on-site/N during/I normal/J business/N hours/N ,/, a/D spokeswoman/N says/V ./.

Garry/N Kasparov/N went/V to/T combat/V Sunday/N with/I the/D world/N 's/P most/J advanced/N chess/N computer/N and/C kicked/N it/P around/J --/N symbolically/N ,/, anyway/N --/N like/I an/D old/J tin/N can/N ./.
Playing/N black/N in/I the/D first/J game/N ,/, the/D human/J champion/N maneuvered/N Deep/N Thought/N ,/, known/V for/I its/P attacking/N prowess/N ,/, into/I a/D totally/J passive/N position/N ./.
Then/N he/P unleashed/V his/P own/N ,/, unstoppable/N ,/, attack/N ./.
And/C in/I the/D second/J game/N ,/, with/I Mr./N Kasparov/N advancing/N ferociously/N as/I white/N ,/, D.T./N offered/V feeble/J resistance/N and/C lost/V even/R faster/R ./.
Well/N ,/, mankind/N can/N rest/N easier/N for/I now/N ./.
Though/N almost/N everybody/N at/I the/D playing/N site/N had/V been/V looking/V for/I the/D 26-year-old/J Soviet/N to/T beat/V the/D Pennsylvania-based/J computer/N ,/, he/P gave/V the/D machine/N a/D far/J worse/J drubbing/N than/I many/J expected/N ./.
And/C when/N Mr./N Kasparov/N strode/N into/I the/D playing/N hall/N ,/, he/P called/V the/D outcome/N ./.
As/N if/I he/P were/V Iron/N Mike/N ,/, about/R to/T enter/V the/D ring/N with/I a/D 98-pound/J weakling/N ,/, he/P declared/N :/: ``/` I/P 'll/M be/V able/J to/T beat/V any/D computer/N for/I the/D next/J five/N years/N ./. ''/'
His/N strategy/N against/I D.T./N was/V based/V on/I a/D thorough/J study/N of/I dozens/N of/I its/P games/N ,/, he/P said/V ,/, including/V its/P notorious/J whippings/N of/I the/D grandmasters/N Bent/N Larsen/N of/I Denmark/N and/C Robert/N Byrne/N of/I the/D U.S./N Mr./N Kasparov/N was/V underwhelmed/N ./.
``/` The/D computer/N 's/P mind/N is/V too/J straight/N ,/, too/N primitive/N ,/, ''/' lacking/V the/D intuition/N and/C creativity/N needed/V to/T reach/V the/D top/N ,/, he/P said/V ./.
The/D champion/N apparently/N was/V not/R worried/V at/I all/D about/J D.T./N 's/P strong/J points/N ./.
Its/N chief/N builder/N ,/, Taiwan-born/N Feng-hsiung/N Hsu/N ,/, nicknamed/V his/P brainchild/N ``/I the/D Weasel/N ''/N for/I its/P tactical/J flair/N at/I wriggling/N out/R of/I horrible/J positions/N ./.
D.T./N also/R has/V a/D prodigious/N and/C flawless/N memory/N ,/, is/V utterly/J fearless/N ,/, and/C could/M n't/R be/V distracted/V by/I the/D sexy/J nude/N sculptures/N spread/N around/I the/D playing/N hall/N ,/, in/I the/D New/N York/N Academy/N of/I Art/N ./.
In/I fact/N ,/, D.T./N never/N left/V home/N ,/, Carnegie/N Mellon/N University/N in/I Pittsburgh/N ,/, but/C communicated/N with/I its/P human/J handlers/N by/I telephone/N link/N ./.
They/P conceded/V that/I the/D odds/N favored/N Mr./N Kasparov/N ,/, but/C they/P put/V their/P hope/N in/I D.T./N 's/P recently/J enhanced/N capacity/N for/I examining/N positions/N --/: up/R to/T a/D million/C per/N second/N ,/, from/I 720,000/N ./.
But/C the/D handlers/N mistakenly/N stuck/N with/I silicon/N chips/N ;/N they/P needed/V kryptonite/N ./.
This/D became/J apparent/N as/I game/N one/N ,/, a/D Sicilian/N Defense/N by/I Mr./N Kasparov/N ,/, proceeded/N ./.
No/D human/J can/N examine/N millions/N of/I moves/N ,/, but/C Mr./N Kasparov/N ,/, using/V his/P ineffably/V powerful/J brain/N ,/, consistently/N found/V very/R good/J ones/N ./.
After/I eight/C moves/N by/I each/D side/N ,/, the/D board/N was/V the/D same/J as/N in/I a/D game/N in/I which/J Nigel/N Short/N of/I Great/N Britain/N fought/V the/D champion/N to/T a/D draw/N in/I 1980/N ./.
But/C the/D computer/N did/V n't/R play/V Mr./N Short/N 's/P ninth/J move/N ,/, a/D key/J pawn/N thrust/N ,/, and/C its/P position/N deteriorated/N rapidly/N ./.
Instead/N of/I castling/N ,/, a/D standard/J measure/N to/T safeguard/V the/D king/N ,/, D.T./N made/V a/D second-rate/J rook/N maneuver/N at/I move/N 13/C ;/N then/N it/P put/V a/D knight/N offside/N on/I move/N 16/N ./.
``/` Only/N two/C classes/N of/I minds/N would/M think/V of/I this/D --/N very/R weak/J human/N players/N ,/, and/C computers/N ,/, ''/' said/V Edmar/N Mednis/N ,/, the/D expert/J commentator/N for/I the/D match/N ,/, which/W was/V attended/V by/I hundreds/N of/I chess/N fans/N ./.
By/I move/N 21/N ,/, D.T./N had/V fallen/V into/I a/D deep/J positional/N trap/N ./.
It/P allowed/V Mr./N Kasparov/N to/T exchange/V his/P dark-squared/J bishop/N for/I one/N of/I D.T./N 's/P knights/N ./.
Bishops/N usually/N are/V worth/J slightly/N more/R than/I knights/N ,/, but/C in/I this/D case/N Mr./N Kasparov/N was/V left/V with/I a/D very/J dangerous/N knight/N and/C D.T./N 's/P surviving/N bishop/N was/V reduced/V to/T passivity/V ./.
Indeed/N ,/, it/P looked/V more/R like/I a/D pawn/N ,/, a/D ``/` tall/J pawn/N ,/, ''/' as/I spectators/N snidely/N put/V it/P ./.
Consistently/N ,/, D.T./N was/V over-optimistic/N about/I its/P chances/N ,/, which/W it/P continually/N sized/V up/R ,/, in/I numerical/J form/N ./.
When/D most/J spectators/N thought/V its/P position/N hopeless/N ,/, the/D computer/N thought/V it/P was/V only/R ,/, in/I effect/N ,/, one-half/N of/I a/D pawn/N down/N ./.
Such/J evaluations/N met/V with/I derision/N ,/, and/C kept/V the/D machine/N from/I resigning/N as/I soon/N as/I humans/N would/M have/V --/R prompting/V more/J derision/N ./.
While/I D.T./N shuffled/V its/P king/N back/N and/C forth/N in/I a/D defensive/J crouch/N ,/, Mr./N Kasparov/N maneuvered/V the/D knight/N to/T a/D dominant/J outpost/N ./.
He/P also/R launched/V a/D kingside/N storm/N ,/, sacrificing/V a/D pawn/N to/T denude/V D.T./N 's/P king/N ./.
No/D amount/N of/I weasling/N could/M have/V saved/V this/D game/N for/I D.T./N
A/D piece/N down/N ,/, the/D computer/N resigned/N ./.
Now/N ,/, with/I the/D crowd/N in/I the/D analysis/N room/N smelling/N figurative/N blood/N ,/, the/D only/J question/N seemed/V to/T be/V how/D fast/J Mr./N Kasparov/N could/M win/V game/N two/C ./.
With/I the/D advantage/N of/I playing/D white/J -LRB-/N which/W moves/V first/J -RRB-/N ,/, Mr./N Kasparov/N followed/V up/R cleverly/V against/I the/D computer/N 's/P defense/N ,/, a/D Queen/N 's/P Gambit/N Accepted/N ./.
As/I early/N as/I move/N six/N ,/, Mr./N Kasparov/N deviated/N from/I a/D well-known/J sequence/N of/I moves/N ,/, developing/V a/D knight/N instead/N of/I making/V a/D standard/J bishop/N attack/N against/I the/D computer/N 's/P advanced/V knight/N ./.
This/N left/V the/D computer/N with/I a/D broader/J range/N of/I plausible/J replies/N --/: and/C it/P immediately/J blundered/N by/I moving/V a/D queenside/N pawn/N ,/, to/T the/D neglect/N of/I kingside/N development/N ./.
``/` In/I a/D new/J position/N just/R after/I the/D opening/N ,/, a/D computer/N will/M have/V serious/J problems/N ,/, ''/' Mr./N Kasparov/N said/V later/R ./.
In/I such/J positions/N ,/, he/P explained/N ,/, ``/` you/P have/V to/T create/V something/D new/J ,/, and/C the/D computer/N is/V n't/R able/V to/T do/V that/I right/J now/N ./. ''/'
After/I only/J 11/N moves/N for/I each/D side/N ,/, the/D computer/N 's/P position/N was/V shaky/N ./.
Greedily/N ,/, it/P grabbed/V a/D pawn/N ,/, at/I the/D cost/N of/I facing/V a/D brutal/J attack/N ./.
And/C when/I a/D defensive/J move/N was/V called/V for/I ,/D D.T./N passed/V up/I an/D obvious/J pawn/N move/N and/C instead/N exposed/V its/P queen/N to/T immediate/V tactical/J threats/N ./.
Mr./N Kasparov/N remarked/V later/R that/I ``/` even/R a/D weak/J club/N player/, ''/' would/M have/V avoided/V the/D queen/N move/N ./.
Now/N ,/, after/I only/R a/D dozen/N moves/N ,/, spectators/N were/V looking/V for/I a/D mating/N combination/N ./.
On/I a/D demonstration/N board/N ,/, emcee/N Shelby/N Lyman/N showed/V a/D quick/J kill/N initiated/N by/I a/D knight/N sacrifice/N ;/I no/D spectator/N refuted/V this/D line/N of/I play/N ./.
Mr./N Kasparov/N 's/P continuation/N was/V slower/N but/C ,/, in/I the/D end/N ,/, just/R as/I deadly/N ./.
He/P won/V D.T./N 's/P queen/N for/I two/C minor/N pieces/N and/C two/C pawns/N --/: not/R enough/J compensation/N ,/, in/I this/D position/N ,/, to/T give/V the/D computer/N much/J hope/N ./.
In/I a/D hopeless/J position/N ,/, the/D computer/N resigned/V rather/R than/I make/V its/P 37th/J move/N ./.
And/C Mr./N Kasparov/N ,/, to/T cheers/$ and/C applause/N ,/, marched/V back/R into/I the/D analysis/N room/N ./.
``/` In/I both/D games/N I/P got/V exactly/R what/V I/P wanted/N ,/, ''/' he/P said/V ./.
What/N he/P had/V demonstrated/N ,/, he/P added/N ,/, is/V that/I there/N 's/P more/J to/T chess/V than/I sheer/J calculation/N ./.

Just/N ask/N Richard/N Blumenfeld/N ,/, a/D New/N Jersey/N dentist/N who/W considers/V himself/P ``/` a/D reasonably/J sophisticated/N investor/N ./. ''/'
In/I May/N 1986/N ,/, Dr./N Blumenfeld/N gave/V Merrill/N Lynch/N &/C Co./N about/I $/$ 40,000/C for/I a/D federally/N insured/V certificate/N of/I deposit/N offering/V an/D effective/J yield/N of/I more/J than/I 9/C %/N ./.
``/` It/P was/V a/D time/N when/N interest/N rates/N came/V down/R very/J rapidly/N ,/, ''/' Dr./N Blumenfeld/N recalls/N ./.
Yields/N on/I five-year/J CDs/N at/I major/J banks/N were/V averaging/V about/I 7.45/N %/N ,/, and/C 10-year/J Treasury/N notes/N were/V paying/V less/R than/I 8/N %/N ./.
The/D CD/N seemed/V like/I a/D great/J deal/N ./.
But/C nearly/N 3/C years/N later/N ,/, Merrill/N says/V the/D investment/N is/V worth/N about/I $/$ 43,000/C --/: an/D amount/N that/I represents/V an/D annual/J return/N of/I just/N over/I 2/C %/N on/I Dr./N Blumenfeld/N 's/P $/$ 40,000/C ./.
The/D problem/N is/V that/I the/D CD/N he/P bought/V for/I a/D retirement/N plan/N was/V n't/R a/D plain/J vanilla/N CD/N ./.
Instead/N ,/, his/P Merrill/N broker/N put/V him/N in/I a/D zero-coupon/J CD/N ,/, which/W is/V sold/V at/I a/D deep/J discount/N to/T its/P face/N value/N ./.
The/D difference/N between/I the/D price/N and/C the/D face/N value/N payable/N at/I maturity/N is/V the/D investor/N 's/P return/N ./.
More/N important/N ,/, the/D CD/N was/V purchased/V on/I the/D secondary/N ,/, or/C resale/N ,/, market/N ./.
Because/I the/D CD/N had/V an/D effective/J yield/N of/I 13.4/N %/N when/W it/P was/V issued/V in/I 1984/N ,/, and/C interest/N rates/N in/I general/N had/V declined/V sharply/R since/I then/N ,/, part/N of/I the/D price/N Dr./N Blumenfeld/N paid/V was/V a/D premium/N --/: an/D additional/J amount/N on/I top/N of/I the/D CD/N 's/P base/N value/N plus/N accrued/N interest/N that/I represented/V the/D CD/N 's/P increased/J market/N value/N ./.
Now/I the/D thrift/N that/I issued/V the/D CD/N is/V insolvent/N ,/, and/C Dr./N Blumenfeld/N has/V learned/V to/T his/P surprise/N that/I the/D premium/N is/V n't/R insured/V under/I federal/J deposit/N insurance/N ./.
The/D tip-off/N came/V when/W he/P opened/V a/D recent/J Merrill/N Lynch/N statement/N and/C found/V that/I the/D CD/N 's/P ``/V estimated/V current/J market/N value/N ''/N had/V plummeted/V by/I $/$ 9,000/C in/I a/D month/N ./.
Several/N phone/N calls/N and/C a/D visit/N to/T his/P broker/N 's/P office/N later/N ,/, the/D dentist/N found/V out/R that/I the/D $/$ 9,000/C drop/N represented/V the/D current/J value/N of/I the/D premium/N he/P paid/V when/W he/P bought/V the/D CD/N ,/, and/C that/I the/D amount/N was/V n't/R insured/V ./.
``/` This/P is/V one/C thing/N I/P was/V never/R aware/J of/N ,/, ''/' he/P says/V ./.

Dr./N Blumenfeld/N is/V n't/R unique/V ./.

``/` There/P is/V just/R a/D tremendous/J amount/N of/I uncertainty/N about/R what/V the/D effect/N ,/, if/I any/D ,/N of/I all/D this/N is/V ,/, ''/' said/V John/N P./N Uphoff/N ,/, an/D analyst/N at/I Raymond/N James/N Associates/N Inc/N ./.
``/` I/P did/V n't/R even/R know/V that/I a/D company/N in/I a/D socialistic/J country/N could/M file/V for/I bankruptcy/N ./. ''/'
Carnival/N said/V the/D ``/J Fantasy/N ,/, ''/' the/D first/J of/I the/D three/C $/$ 200/C million/C ships/N that/I Carnival/N has/V on/I order/N ,/, is/V scheduled/V to/T be/V delivered/V next/J month/N ,/, just/R in/I time/N for/I the/D winter/N tourist/N season/N in/I the/D Caribbean/N ./.
That/D ship/N ,/, which/W would/M carry/V about/I 2,050/N passengers/N ,/, would/M expand/V the/D capacity/N of/I Carnival/N 's/P existing/V 14-ship/J fleet/N by/I 24/N %/N ./.

Eaton/N Corp./N had/V a/D 26/J %/N drop/N in/I third-quarter/J profit/N mainly/N because/I of/I lower/J sales/N of/I truck/N parts/N ,/, its/P largest/J and/C most/J profitable/J single/J business/N ./.
Sales/N of/I medium/N and/C heavy-duty/N trucks/N continue/V to/T lag/V previous-year/J rates/N ,/, leading/V Eaton/N to/T expect/V fourth-quarter/D net/J income/N to/T fall/V below/I year-earlier/J levels/N ,/, said/V Stephen/N R./N Hardis/N ,/, vice/N chairman/N and/C chief/N financial/N and/C administrative/J officer/N ./.

The/D quarter/N net/N was/V below/I analyst/N expectations/N mainly/N because/I truck-parts/N sales/N did/V n't/R rebound/V in/I September/N from/I the/D summer/N doldrums/N as/I they/P usually/N do/V ,/, said/V Patrick/N E./N Sheridan/N ,/, analyst/N with/I McDonald/N &/C Co/N ./.
Mr./N Sheridan/N ,/, who/W had/V been/V expecting/J quarter/N profit/N of/I about/I $/$ 1.25/C a/D share/N ,/, says/V he/P is/V reducing/V his/P estimate/N for/I the/D year/N to/T the/D area/N of/I $/$ 5.70/C a/D share/N ,/, from/I his/P previous/J estimate/N of/I $/$ 6.10/C ./.

Eaton/N does/V n't/R provide/V profit/N figures/N separately/N for/I each/D category/N ,/, but/C operating/N profit/N for/I vehicle/N parts/N as/I a/D group/N fell/V 26/J %/N to/T $/$ 51/C million/C on/I an/D about/N 1/C %/N drop/N in/I sales/N to/T $/$ 488/C million/C ./.
Mr./N Hardis/N said/V truck-fleet/J operators/N appear/V to/T be/V cautious/V about/R buying/V new/J trucks/N until/I they/P see/V how/I the/D economy/N behaves/N ./.
The/D truck/N sales/N slowdown/N reflects/V the/D general/J slowing/N in/I sales/N of/I consumer/N goods/N ,/, he/P said/V ,/, and/C the/D latest/J reports/N show/V a/D slight/J improvement/N rather/N than/I any/D indication/N of/I a/D downward/J spiral/N ./.

In/I Poland/N 's/P rapid/J shift/N from/I socialism/N to/T an/D undefined/J alternative/N ,/, environmental/J issues/N have/V become/V a/D cutting/N edge/N of/I broader/J movements/N to/T restructure/V the/D economy/N ,/, cut/V cumbersome/J bureaucracies/N ,/, and/C democratize/N local/N politics/N ./.
Initial/N steps/N were/V taken/V at/I Poland/N 's/P first/J international/J environmental/J conference/N ,/, which/W I/P attended/V last/J month/N ./.
The/D conference/N ,/, held/V in/I Lower/N Silesia/N ,/, was/V co-sponsored/N by/I the/D Environment/N Ministry/N ,/, the/D Rockefeller/N Brothers/N Fund/N ,/, and/C the/D Polish/N Ecological/N Club/N ,/, and/C was/V attended/V by/I 50/C Poles/N from/I government/N and/C industry/N ,/, as/I well/N as/I Hungarians/N ,/, Czechs/N ,/, Russians/N ,/, Japanese/N and/C Americans/N ./.
The/D conference/N was/V entitled/V ``/J Economic/N Mechanisms/N for/I Environmental/N Protection/N ,/, ''/' a/D significant/J departure/N from/I East/N Bloc/N usage/N ,/, which/W recognizes/V only/R one/C economic/J mechanism/N --/: central/J planning/N --/: to/T direct/V industrial/J behavior/N ./.
Even/R more/J remarkably/N ,/, it/P focused/V on/I emissions/N trading/N and/C similar/J market/N approaches/N to/T address/V pollution/N ,/, notwithstanding/N Poland/N 's/P lack/N of/I functioning/N markets/N ./.
Why/N did/V East/N Bloc/N participants/N unanimously/N endorse/V market-based/J pollution/N approaches/N ?/.
The/D answer/N lies/N both/N in/I the/D degraded/J environment/N of/I these/D countries/N and/C the/D perceived/J causes/N of/I that/D degradation/N ./.
Like/I other/J East/N Bloc/N countries/N ,/, Poland/N possesses/V environmental/J laws/N more/J honored/N in/I their/P breach/N than/I in/I their/P observance/N ./.
According/N to/T a/D detailed/J report/N by/I Zbigniew/N Bochniarz/N of/I the/D University/N of/I Minnesota/N 's/P Hubert/N Humphrey/N Institute/N ,/, 27/C areas/N containing/V a/D third/J of/I Poland/N 's/P population/N are/V regarded/V as/I ``/D ecological/J hazards/N ''/N due/V to/T multiple/V violations/N of/I standards/N ./.
Norms/N are/V consistently/R exceeded/V at/I 60/C %/N of/I nitrogen/N oxide/N monitoring/N sites/N and/C 80/C %/N of/I those/N for/I dust/N and/C soot/N emissions/N ./.
Four-fifths/N of/I Poland/N 's/P soils/N have/V become/V highly/R acidified/V ;/J 70/N %/N of/I its/P southern/J forests/N are/V projected/V to/T die/V by/I century/N 's/P end/N ./.
Between/N 1965/N and/C 1985/N ,/, Polish/N waters/N fit/N for/I human/J consumption/N dropped/V from/I 33/N %/N to/T 6/C %/N of/I all/D surface/N waters/N ,/, while/I those/D unfit/J even/N for/I industry/N use/V nearly/R doubled/V ./.
Poland/N produces/V about/I 20/C times/N more/J soot/N and/C five/C times/N more/J sulfur/N dioxide/N and/C solid/N waste/N per/I unit/N of/I gross/D national/J product/N than/I does/D Western/J Europe/N ./.
Its/N mortality/N rate/N for/I males/N over/I 35/N is/V about/I 50/C %/N higher/N than/I West/N Germany/N 's/P ,/, and/C 50/C %/N higher/N in/I hazard/N areas/N than/I the/D national/J average/N ./.
Since/I 1978/N ,/, average/J annual/J growth/N rates/N for/I most/J pollutants/N have/V outstripped/V the/D growth/N of/I GNP/N ./.
Conference/N participants/N saw/V these/D effects/N as/I flowing/N directly/N from/I -LRB-/V a/D -RRB-/J Marxist/N devaluation/N of/I environmental/J resources/N ,/, which/W are/V not/R produced/V by/I labor/N ;/N -LRB-/N b/N -RRB-/V planned/J economies/N '/P inability/V to/T control/V pollution/N where/N enterprises/N are/V state-owned/N and/C penalties/N are/V paid/V by/I the/D government/N ;/N and/C -LRB-/N c/N -RRB-/I the/D continuing/J Stalinist/N emphasis/N on/I heavy/J industry/N for/I economic/J development/N ,/, producing/V a/D far/J heavier/N and/C more/J wasteful/N use/N of/I energy/N and/C natural/N resources/N than/I in/I the/D West/N ./.
They/P repeatedly/N noted/V that/I environmental/J progress/N could/M not/R be/V secured/V without/I true/J ownership/N ,/, genuine/N competition/N based/V on/I market/N factors/N ,/, and/C the/D risk/N of/I bankruptcy/N if/I a/D business/N makes/V the/D wrong/J decisions/N ./.
The/D solutions/N they/P formally/N proposed/V included/V taxes/N ,/, conservation/N and/C recycling/N incentives/N ,/, reforestation/N offsets/N ,/, transferable/N pollution/N permits/N ,/, an/D ecological/J bank/N to/T finance/V pollution-reduction/J credits/N ,/, and/C debt-for-environment/N swaps/N ./.
But/C their/P most/J fundamental/N recommendation/N was/V to/T separate/V industry/N from/I the/D state/N ,/, making/V it/P fully/N accountable/N for/I pollution/N control/N ./.
A/D revolution/N takes/V more/R than/I conference/N manifestos/N ./.
Indeed/N ,/, skepticism/N was/V amply/J captured/N by/I a/D joke/N told/V by/I Poles/N at/I the/D conference/N :/: ``/` The/D world/N must/M be/V coming/V to/T an/D end/N ./.

But/C the/D implications/N of/I such/J a/D shift/N to/T market/N approaches/N go/V well/R beyond/I the/D fact/N that/I Poland/N is/V already/R working/V on/I nationwide/J emissions/N trades/N to/T reduce/V smelter/J pollution/N ,/, or/C that/I the/D Soviets/N plan/N to/T introduce/V marketable/J pollution/N permits/N in/I some/D republics/N next/I year/N ./.

--/D Least-cost/J solutions/N ./.
As/I conferees/N noted/N ,/, scarce/N capital/N means/V the/D costs/N of/I control/N must/M be/V minimized/V through/I a/D broad/J menu/N of/I compliance/N choices/N for/I individual/J firms/N ./.
That/D means/N simple/N ,/, clear/J rules/N that/I secure/V the/D first/J large/J blocks/N of/I reduction/N ,/, deferring/V more/R complex/J issues/N such/N as/I risk/N ./.
It/P also/R means/V use/N of/I quantity-based/J pollution/N limits/V such/J as/I transferable/J permits/N ,/, rather/R than/I price-based/N limits/V such/J as/I effluent/J fees/N ./.

Why/N ca/V n't/R we/P teach/V our/P children/N to/T read/V ,/, write/N and/C reckon/N ?/.
It/P 's/V not/R that/I we/P do/V n't/R know/V how/V to/T ,/V because/I we/P do/V ./.
It/P 's/V that/I we/P do/V n't/R want/V to/T ./.
And/C the/D reason/N we/P do/V n't/R want/V to/T is/V that/I effective/J education/N would/M require/V us/V to/T relinquish/V some/D cherished/N metaphysical/N beliefs/N about/I human/J nature/N in/I general/N and/C the/D human/J nature/N of/I young/J people/N in/I particular/N ,/, as/R well/R as/R to/T violate/V some/D cherished/N vested/N interests/N ./.
These/D beliefs/N so/R dominate/V our/P educational/J establishment/N ,/, our/P media/N ,/, our/P politicians/N ,/, and/C even/R our/J parents/N that/I it/P seems/V almost/R blasphemous/V to/T challenge/V them/P ./.
Here/R is/V an/D example/N ./.
If/I I/P were/V to/T ask/V a/D sample/N of/I American/N parents/N ,/, ``/` Do/V you/P wish/V the/D elementary/J schools/N to/T encourage/V creativity/N in/I your/N children/N ?/. ''/' the/D near-unanimous/J answer/N would/M be/V ,/, ``/` Yes/N ,/, of/I course/N ./. ''/'
But/C what/N do/V we/P mean/N ,/, specifically/N ,/, by/I ``/D creativity/N ''/N ?/.
No/D one/N can/M say/V ./.
In/I practice/N ,/, it/P ends/V up/R being/V equated/V with/I a/D ``/N self-expression/, ''/' that/W encourages/V the/D youngsters/N '/P ``/J self-esteem/N ./. ''/'
The/D result/N is/V a/D generation/N of/I young/J people/N whose/N ignorance/N and/C intellectual/N incompetence/N is/V matched/V only/R by/I their/P good/J opinion/N of/I themselves/N ./.
The/D whole/J notion/N of/I ``/D creativity/N ''/N in/I education/N was/V -LRB-/N and/C is/V -RRB-/J part/N and/C parcel/N of/I a/D romantic/J rebellion/N against/I disciplined/J instruction/N ,/, which/W was/V -LRB-/N and/C is/V -RRB-/J regarded/N as/I ``/D authoritarian/N ,/, ''/' a/D repression/N and/C frustration/N of/I the/D latent/N talents/N and/C the/D wonderful/N ,/, if/N as/I yet/N undefined/N ,/, potentialities/N inherent/N in/I the/D souls/N of/I all/D our/J children/N ./.
It/P is/V not/R surprising/V that/I parents/N find/V this/D romantic/J extravagance/N so/I attractive/N ./.
Fortunately/N ,/, these/D same/J parents/N do/V want/V their/P children/N to/T get/V a/D decent/J education/N as/I traditionally/N understood/N ,/, and/C they/P have/V enough/R common/J sense/N to/T know/V what/N that/I demands/N ./.
Their/N commitment/N to/T ``/` creativity/N ''/' can/M not/R survive/V adolescent/J illiteracy/N ./.
American/N education/N 's/P future/N will/M be/V determined/V by/I the/D degree/N to/T which/V we/P --/V all/R of/I us/P --/N allow/V this/D common/J sense/N to/T prevail/V over/I the/D illusions/N that/I we/P also/J share/N ./.
The/D education/N establishment/N will/M fight/V against/I common/J sense/N every/N inch/N of/I the/D way/N ./.
The/D reasons/N are/V complex/N ,/, but/C one/C simple/J reason/N ought/V not/R to/T be/V underestimated/N ./.
``/` Progressive/J education/N ''/N -LRB-/N as/I it/P was/V once/R called/V -RRB-/R is/V far/R more/J interesting/N and/C agreeable/N to/T teachers/V than/I is/V disciplined/J instruction/N ./.
It/P is/V nice/N for/I teachers/N to/T think/V they/P are/V engaged/V in/I ``/D personality/N development/N ''/N and/C even/R nicer/V to/T minimize/V those/D irksome/J tests/N with/I often/D disappointing/J results/N ./.
It/P also/R provides/V teachers/N with/I a/D superior/J self-definition/N as/I a/D ``/J profession/N ,/, ''/' since/I they/P will/M have/V passed/J courses/N in/I educational/J psychology/N and/C educational/J philosophy/N ./.
I/P myself/N took/V such/J courses/N in/I college/N ,/, thinking/V I/P might/J end/N up/I a/D schoolteacher/N ./.
They/P could/V all/D fairly/N be/V described/V as/I ``/D pap/N ''/N courses/N ./.
But/C it/P is/V unfair/V to/T dump/V on/I teachers/N ,/, as/I distinct/N from/I the/D educational/J establishment/N ./.
I/P know/V many/J schoolteachers/N and/C ,/, on/I the/D whole/N ,/, they/P are/V seriously/R committed/V to/T conscientious/V teaching/N ./.
They/P may/M not/R be/V among/I the/D ``/J best/N and/C brightest/N ''/N of/I their/P generation/N --/: there/R are/V very/R few/J such/J people/N ,/, by/I definition/N ./.
But/C they/P need/V not/R be/V to/T do/V their/P jobs/V well/R ./.
Yes/N ,/, we/V all/D can/N remember/N one/C or/C two/C truly/N inspiring/N teachers/N from/I our/P school/N days/N ./.
But/C our/N education/N proceeded/N at/I the/D hands/N of/I those/D others/N ,/, who/W were/V merely/J competent/N and/C conscientious/N ./.
In/I this/D sense/N ,/, a/D teacher/N can/M be/V compared/V to/T one/C 's/P family/N doctor/N ./.
If/I he/P were/V brilliant/N ,/, he/P probably/N would/M not/R be/V a/D family/N doctor/N in/I the/D first/J place/N ./.
If/I he/P is/V competent/N and/C conscientious/N ,/, he/P serves/V us/V well/R ./.
Our/N teachers/N are/V not/R an/D important/J factor/N in/I our/P educational/J crisis/N ./.
Whether/N they/P are/V or/C are/V not/R underpaid/V is/V a/D problem/N of/I equity/N ;/N it/P is/V not/R an/D educational/J problem/N ./.
It/P is/V silly/J libel/N on/I our/P teachers/N to/T think/V they/P would/M educate/V our/P children/N better/N if/I only/N they/P got/V a/D few/J thousand/N dollars/I a/D year/N more/R ./.
It/P is/V the/D kind/N of/I libel/N the/D teachers/N '/P unions/N do/V n't/R mind/V spreading/N ,/, for/I their/P own/J narrow/J purposes/N ./.
It/P is/V also/R the/D kind/N of/I libel/N politicians/N find/V useful/N ,/, since/I it/P helps/V them/P strike/V a/D friendly/J posture/N on/I behalf/N of/I an/D important/J constituency/N ./.
But/C there/N is/V not/R one/C shred/N of/I evidence/N that/I ,/D other/J things/N being/V equal/N ,/, salary/N differentials/N result/N in/I educational/J differentials/N ./.
If/I there/N were/V such/J evidence/N ,/, you/P can/M be/V sure/V you/P would/M have/V heard/V of/I it/P ./.
If/I we/P wish/V to/T be/V serious/J about/I American/N education/N ,/, we/P know/V exactly/R what/V to/T do/V --/: and/C ,/, just/R as/I important/N ,/, what/W not/R to/T do/V ./.
There/N are/V many/J successful/J schools/N scattered/N throughout/I this/D nation/N ,/, some/D of/I them/N in/I the/D poorest/N of/I ghettos/N ,/, and/C they/P are/V all/D sending/N us/I the/D same/J message/N ./.
Conversely/N ,/, there/R are/V the/D majority/N of/I unsuccessful/J schools/N ,/, and/C we/P know/V which/J efforts/N at/I educational/J reform/N are/V doomed/J beforehand/N ./.
We/P really/N do/V know/V all/D we/N need/V to/T know/V ,/, if/I only/N we/P could/M assimilate/V this/D knowledge/N into/I our/P thinking/N ./.
In/I this/D respect/N ,/, it/P would/M be/V helpful/N if/I our/P political/J leaders/N were/V mute/N ,/, rather/R than/I eloquently/D ``/J concerned/N ./. ''/'
They/P are/V inevitably/R inclined/V to/T echo/V the/D conventional/J pap/N ,/, since/I this/D is/V the/D least/J controversial/N option/N that/I is/V open/V to/T them/V ./.
Thus/N at/I the/D recent/J governors/N '/P conference/N on/I education/N ,/, Gov./N Bill/N Clinton/N of/I Arkansas/N announced/V that/I ``/` this/D country/N needs/V a/D comprehensive/J child-development/N policy/N for/I children/N under/I five/C ./. ''/'
A/D comprehensive/J development/N policy/N for/I governors/N over/I 30/C would/M seem/V to/T be/V a/D more/J pressing/N need/N ./.
What/N Gov./N Clinton/N is/V advocating/N ,/, in/I effect/N ,/, is/V extending/V the/D educational/J system/N down/V to/T the/D pre-kindergarten/N years/N ./.
Whether/N desirable/N or/C not/R ,/, this/D is/V a/D child-care/J program/N ,/, not/R an/D educational/J program/N ./.
We/P know/V that/I very/D early/J exposure/N to/T schooling/V improves/J performance/N in/I the/D first/J grade/N ,/, but/C afterward/I the/D difference/N is/V quickly/R washed/V away/R ./.
Let/N us/P sum/V up/R what/V we/P do/V know/V about/I education/N and/C about/I those/D education/N reforms/N that/I do/D work/N and/C do/V n't/R work/V :/N --/: ``/` Parental/J involvement/N ''/N is/V a/D bad/J idea/N ./.
Parents/N are/V too/R likely/V to/T blame/V schools/N for/I the/D educational/J limitations/N of/I their/P children/N ./.

If/I parents/N are/V dissatisfied/V with/I a/D school/N ,/, they/P should/M have/V the/D option/N of/I switching/N to/T another/V ./.
--/: ``/` Community/N involvement/, ''/' is/V an/D even/R worse/J idea/N ./.
Here/N ,/, the/D experience/N of/I New/N York/N City/N is/V decisive/N ./.

New/N York/N is/V in/I the/D process/N of/I trying/V to/T disengage/V itself/N from/I a/D 20-year-old/J commitment/N to/T this/D system/N of/I school/N governance/N ,/, even/R as/I Chicago/N and/C other/J cities/N are/V moving/V to/T institute/V it/P ./.
--/N In/I most/J states/N ,/, increasing/V expenditures/N on/I education/N ,/, in/I our/P current/J circumstances/N ,/, will/M probably/R make/V things/N worse/N ,/, not/R better/J ./.
The/D reason/N is/V simple/J :/N Education/N takes/V place/N in/I the/D classroom/N ,/, where/W the/D influence/N of/I money/N is/V minimal/N ./.
Decades/N of/I educational/J research/N tell/V us/P unequivocally/N that/I even/D smaller/J classes/N have/V zero/J effect/N on/I the/D academic/J performance/N of/I the/D pupils/N --/N though/I they/P may/M sometimes/R be/V desirable/N for/I other/J reasons/N ./.

The/D company/N unveiled/V more/R than/I 50/C products/N ,/, mostly/N software/N ,/, that/W are/V designed/V to/T integrate/V the/D three/J areas/N of/I a/D manufacturing/N operation/N --/: the/D plant/N floor/N ,/, design/N operations/N and/C production/N planning/N ./.
The/D aim/N ,/, ultimately/N ,/, is/V to/T increase/V the/D flow/N of/I information/N into/I a/D manufacturer/N 's/P main/J computer/N network/N for/I use/N in/I business/N planning/N ,/, marketing/N and/C other/J operations/N ./.
Manufacturers/N have/V already/R spent/V so/R heavily/V on/I automation/N that/I they/P are/V one/N of/I the/D computer/N industry/N 's/P leading/V revenue/N sources/N ./.
But/C many/J manufacturers/N find/V that/I communication/N between/I different/J computers/N has/V been/V rendered/V nearly/R impossible/V by/I the/D babel/N of/I computer/N languages/N used/V by/I different/J machines/N ,/, including/V robots/N and/C machine/N tools/N ./.
IBM/N 's/P announcement/N ,/, which/W was/V expected/V and/C will/M formally/V be/V made/V to/T customers/N today/N ,/, also/R marks/V an/D attempt/N to/T gain/V credibility/N on/I the/D plant/N floor/N ,/, where/N Digital/N Equipment/N Corp./N has/V long/J dominated/N and/C where/N Hewlett-Packard/N Co./N has/V recently/R gained/V market/N share/N ./.

Sam/N Albert/N ,/, a/D consultant/N in/I Scarsdale/N ,/, N.Y./N ,/, said/V that/I in/I the/D past/J IBM/N has/V developed/V broad/J software/N strategies/N only/R for/I problems/N that/I crossed/N industry/N lines/N ./.
He/P said/V he/P believes/V IBM/N 's/P decision/N to/T invest/V this/D sort/N of/I effort/N into/I a/D single/J industry/N showed/V that/I it/P was/V getting/V serious/J about/I understanding/N customers/N '/P problems/N and/C was/V n't/R just/R selling/V technology/N ./.

IBM/N 's/P push/N is/V also/R unusual/V in/I its/P approach/V to/T marketing/N ./.
Rather/N than/I just/R send/V out/I marketing/N people/N to/T knock/V on/I customers/N '/P doors/N ,/, IBM/N is/V making/V several/J hundred/N of/I its/P own/J manufacturing/N people/N available/V to/T discuss/V specific/J needs/N ./.
IBM/N 's/P manufacturing/N staff/N also/R will/M be/V able/J to/T provide/V software/N that/I IBM/N has/V developed/J internally/N and/C will/M be/V able/J to/T form/V teams/N with/I a/D customer/N to/T jointly/V solve/J manufacturing/N problems/N ./.
IBM/N can/M obviously/V bring/V its/P expertise/V to/T bear/V on/I problems/N related/V to/T computer/N manufacturing/N ,/, but/C it/P could/M also/R help/V customers/N on/I software/N to/T deal/V with/I such/J things/N as/I changes/N in/I engineering/N documents/N ./.

For/I a/D brief/N time/N ,/, the/D buy-out/N effort/N seemed/V to/T solve/V his/P problems/N with/I United/N 's/P pilot/N union/N ./.
In/I return/N for/I an/D ownership/N stake/N in/I the/D company/N ,/, the/D pilots/N were/V willing/V to/T agree/V to/T a/D seven-year/J contract/N that/I included/V a/D no-strike/J clause/N and/C significant/J wage/N concessions/N and/C productivity/N gains/V the/D union/N previously/N resisted/N ./.
That/D contract/N was/V tied/V to/T the/D success/N of/I the/D buy-out/N ./.
As/I a/D ``/J good-will/N measure/N ,/, ''/' the/D pilots/N had/V been/V working/V four/C extra/N hours/I a/D month/N and/C had/V agreed/V to/T fly/V UAL/N 's/P two/V new/J Boeing/N 747-400/N aircraft/N ./.
It/P 's/V uncertain/N if/I the/D pilots/N will/M continue/V to/T do/V so/R without/I a/D contract/N settlement/N ./.
The/D union/N said/V late/R last/J night/N that/I it/P is/V still/R committed/V to/T majority/N employee/N ownership/N and/C that/I the/D labor/N disputes/N that/I faced/V the/D company/N prior/V to/T the/D buy-out/N effort/N ``/V still/R need/V to/T be/V addressed/N ./. ''/'
The/D buy-out/N effort/N also/R worsened/V already-strained/J relations/N between/I United/N 's/P pilot/N and/C machinist/N unions/N ./.

The/D machinists/N previously/N had/V shown/V themselves/V to/T be/V an/D ally/N to/T Mr./N Wolf/N ,/, but/C he/P lost/V much/R of/I his/P credibility/N with/I that/D group/N when/W he/P teamed/V up/R with/I the/D pilot/N union/N ./.
The/D machinists/N criticized/V the/D terms/N Mr./N Wolf/N and/C management/N received/V in/I the/D buy-out/N ./.

David/N Boren/N ,/, the/D Intelligence/N Committee/N chairman/N ,/, is/V upset/N that/I someone/N leaked/V a/D letter/N to/T the/D committee/N from/I the/D Reagan/N administration/N suggesting/N that/I the/D U.S./N would/M undertake/V to/T warn/V Panamanian/J thug/N Manuel/N Noriega/N if/I it/P got/V wind/N of/I an/D impending/J coup/N that/I might/D result/N in/I his/P assassination/N ./.
With/I due/J respect/N to/T ``/V highly/R classified/J correspondence/N ''/N and/C other/J buzzwords/N ,/, the/D leakers/N are/V performing/V a/D public/J service/N ./.
If/I the/D CIA/N has/V become/V a/D protection/N service/N for/I Mr./N Noriega/N ,/, the/D American/N people/N ought/V to/T know/V ./.
What/N went/V wrong/N in/I Panama/N is/V a/D fitting/J subject/N for/I public/N and/C congressional/J inquiry/N ./.
Naturally/N ,/, Senator/N Boren/N and/C his/P committee/N would/M like/V free/J rein/N to/T blame/V the/D executive/J branch/N while/I stamping/D ``/J top/N secret/N ''/N on/I their/P own/J complicity/N ./.
But/C there/N 's/V no/D danger/N of/I exposing/N sources/N and/C methods/N in/I disclosing/V the/D debate/N running/V up/I and/C down/I Pennsylvania/N Avenue/N ./.
And/C if/I Congress/N is/V going/V to/T assume/V authority/N to/T micromanage/V foreign/J policy/N ,/, it/P 's/V going/V to/T have/V to/T take/V some/D of/I the/D responsibility/N too/N ./.
The/D President/N of/I the/D United/N States/N urged/V the/D Panamanian/J armed/N forces/N to/T move/V against/I Mr./N Noriega/N ./.
When/N they/P did/V ,/, his/P commanders/N did/V n't/R have/V the/D initiative/N to/T do/V more/R than/I block/V a/D couple/N of/I roads/N ./.

But/C what/N kind/N of/I initiative/N can/N you/P expect/V given/V the/D climate/N set/N by/I Congress/N ?/.
For/I example/N ,/, what/W exactly/V did/V the/D CIA/N tell/N Major/N Giroldi/N and/C his/P fellow/N coup/N plotters/N about/I U.S./N laws/N and/C executive/N orders/N on/I assassinations/N ?/.

Mr./N Noriega/N did/V n't/R suffer/V from/I any/D hesitation/N once/I he/P had/V the/D pistol/N ./.
Maybe/N we/P need/V a/D CIA/N version/N of/I the/D Miranda/N warning/N :/: You/P have/V the/D right/N to/T conceal/V your/P coup/N intentions/N ,/, because/I we/P may/M rat/V on/I you/N ./.

CIA/N chief/N William/N Webster/N ,/, hardly/V a/D Washington/N malcontent/N ,/, got/V the/D debate/N started/V last/J week/N by/I noting/N that/I the/D executive/J order/N banning/N assassinations/N had/V contributed/V to/T U.S./N paralysis/N during/I the/D coup/N ./.
The/D CIA/N 's/P Deputy/N Director/N of/I Operations/N ,/, Richard/N Stoltz/N ,/, tried/V to/T smooth/V things/N over/I a/D few/J days/N later/N ,/, but/C instead/N simply/N underlined/N Mr./N Webster/N 's/P point/N ./.

There/N are/V of/I course/N good/N reasons/I the/D U.S./N should/M n't/R get/V into/I the/D assassination/N business/N ,/, but/C rescinding/V the/D executive/J order/N is/V not/R the/D same/J thing/N as/I saying/V the/D U.S./N should/M start/V passing/V out/I exploding/N cigars/N ./.

The/D executive/J order/N and/C the/D reported/J agreements/N with/I the/D Intelligence/N Committee/N are/V neither/D sensible/J nor/N moral/N ./.

But/C Mr./N Roman/N flatly/N denied/V the/D speculation/N ,/, saying/V Mr./N Sorrell/N had/V tried/V several/J times/N to/T persuade/V him/V to/T stay/V ,/, offering/V various/J incentives/N and/C in/I one/C instance/N sending/V a/D note/N with/I a/D case/N of/I wine/N -LRB-/I The/D wine/N ,/, naturally/N ,/, was/V Seagram/N 's/P brand/N ,/, an/D Ogilvy/N client/N -RRB-/N ./.

Mr./N Roman/N also/R brushed/V aside/J reports/N about/I infighting/N between/I him/N and/C Mr./N Phillips/N ,/, his/P successor/N at/I Ogilvy/N ./.

The/D company/N 's/P latest/J moves/N were/V disclosed/V after/I the/D Australian/J Stock/N Exchange/N suspended/N trading/N in/I shares/N of/I Qintex/N Australia/N and/C Qintex/N Ltd./N because/I the/D companies/N had/V n't/R answered/V an/D exchange/N inquiry/N about/I the/D extent/N of/I their/P loans/N ,/, investments/N and/C deposits/N at/I Qintex/N Entertainment/N ./.

It/P said/V Qintex/N Entertainment/N owes/N Qintex/N Australia/N US$/N 38.1/N million/C in/I loans/N not/R secured/V by/I specific/J assets/N ./.
Qintex/N Australia/N also/R said/V it/P has/V an/D investment/N of/I A$/$ 83.3/C million/C in/I Qintex/N Entertainment/N shares/N ./.
In/I the/D statement/N ,/, Mr./N Skase/N said/V that/I on/I the/D basis/N of/I current/J interest/N rates/N in/I Australia/N ,/, the/D company/N 's/P asset/N sales/N would/M reduce/V interest/N expense/N by/I about/I A$/$ 120/C million/C a/D year/N in/I addition/N to/T eliminating/V certain/J liabilities/N ./.
In/I March/N ,/, Qintex/N sold/V 49/J %/N of/I the/D three/J Mirage/N resorts/N to/T Japan/V 's/P Nippon/N Shinpan/N Co./N and/C Mitsui/N &/C Co./N for/I A$/N 433/N million/C ./.
Yesterday/N 's/P statement/N did/V n't/R say/V whether/I the/D Japanese/J companies/N will/M acquire/V Qintex/N 's/P remaining/V stake/N in/I the/D resorts/N ./.
Before/I its/P shares/N were/V suspended/V from/I trading/N ,/, Qintex/N Australia/N plunged/V to/T 16/V Australian/J cents/N -LRB-/N 12/C U.S./N cents/N -RRB-/I a/D share/N yesterday/N from/I 33/D Australian/J cents/N Friday/N ./.
The/D shares/N traded/V at/I about/R A$/J 1.50/N in/I March/N ,/, when/W the/D plan/N to/T acquire/V was/V announced/V ./.
Qintex/N Ltd./N shares/N sank/V to/T A$/V 1.50/N yesterday/N from/I A$/N 3.05/N Friday/N ./.
Mr./N Skase/N 's/P statement/N cited/V four/D recent/J problems/N that/I he/P said/V had/V cut/V group/N cash/N flow/N by/I more/J than/I A$/$ 200/C million/C ./.
They/P were/V what/V he/P called/V an/D ``/J unlawful/N termination/N ''/N by/I of/I the/D acquisition/N agreement/N with/I Qintex/N ,/, high/J Australian/N interest/N rates/N ,/, a/D pilots/N '/P strike/N at/I Australian/D domestic/J airlines/N that/I cut/N revenue/N at/I the/D company/N 's/P Australian/J resorts/N and/C delays/N in/I completing/V a/D sale/N of/I two/C regional/N TV/N stations/N in/I Queensland/N state/N ./.

Qintex/N Australia/N has/V n't/R yet/R reported/V results/N for/I the/D fiscal/J year/N ended/V July/N 31/N ./.
In/I his/P statement/N ,/, Mr./N Skase/N said/V preliminary/J accounts/N showed/V that/I group/N profit/N before/I interest/N ,/, tax/N and/C depreciation/N ``/N will/M exceed/V A$/J 170/N million/C ./. ''/'
He/P gave/V no/D further/J details/N ./.
Shareholders/N '/P funds/N as/I of/I July/N 31/N were/V estimated/V at/I more/J than/I A$/$ 1/C billion/C ,/, Mr./N Skase/N said/V ,/, compared/V with/I A$/$ 725/C million/C a/D year/N earlier/N ./.
The/D company/N will/M make/V ``/` adequate/J provisions/N ''/V to/T cover/V costs/N of/I the/D dispute/N with/I and/C any/D loss/N from/I the/D investment/N in/I Qintex/N Entertainment/N ,/, he/P said/V ./.
Mr./N Skase/N also/R disclosed/V a/D disagreement/N among/I directors/N of/I Qintex/N Australia/N over/I certain/J fees/N claimed/V by/I Qintex/N Group/N Management/N Services/N Pty./N ,/, a/D management-services/J concern/N in/I which/J Qintex/N Australia/N executives/N have/V an/D interest/N ./.
Qintex/N Australia/N paid/V the/D management/N company/N A$/N 32.6/N million/C in/I the/D latest/J fiscal/J year/N ./.
Mr./N Skase/N said/V most/R of/I the/D money/N went/V to/T other/J parties/N for/I expenses/D such/J as/I rent/N and/C travel/N ,/, but/C a/D smaller/J portion/N is/V owed/V to/T senior/J executives/N and/C others/N for/I management/N services/N ./.
Non-executive/N directors/N of/I Qintex/N Australia/N ,/, who/W must/M approve/V payments/N to/T the/D senior/J executives/N ,/, balked/N at/I the/D amount/N ./.
Two/N of/I the/D directors/N resigned/N ,/, Mr./N Skase/N said/V ,/, so/I the/D payments/N have/V n't/R yet/R been/V approved/V ./.
Chip/N 's/P Memory/N Is/V Here/J Today/N ,/, Here/N Tomorrow/.
TWO/N COMPANIES/N plan/N to/T market/V a/D new/J chip/N with/I ceramic/J circuits/N that/I store/N data/N even/R when/V the/D power/N is/V off/R ./.
Today/N 's/P most/J widely/N used/V data-storing/J chips/N have/V ``/` volatile/J ''/N memories/N --/: their/P data/N disappear/N if/I they/P are/V n't/R fed/V a/D steady/J diet/N of/I electricity/N ,/, so/I they/P need/V external/J power/N supplies/N ./.
National/N Semiconductor/N Corp./N and/C a/D start-up/N named/V Ramtron/N Corp./N plan/N to/T start/V shipping/V so-called/J ferroelectric/N memories/N ,/, which/W can/M remember/V data/N for/I at/I least/J 10/N years/N without/I any/D current/J flowing/N to/T them/V ./.
The/D chips/N use/N materials/N ,/, such/J as/I lead/J zirconate/N titanate/N ,/, to/T form/V microscopic/J switches/N that/I retain/N their/P data/N without/I electricity/N ./.
Developers/N caution/N that/I broad/J applications/N are/V several/J years/N away/N because/I the/D technology/N is/V n't/R fully/J refined/N ./.
But/C Ramtron/N of/I Colorado/N Springs/N ,/, Colo./N ,/, plans/V to/T start/V shipping/V commercial/J quantities/N of/I simple/D ferroelectric/J chips/N in/I December/N ./.
The/D company/N expects/V the/D chips/N eventually/V to/T be/V used/V in/I devices/N that/I mimic/V a/D whole/J range/N of/I computer/N memory/N equipment/N ,/, including/V floppy-disk/N and/C hard-disk/N drives/N ./.
National/N Semiconductor/N is/V getting/V ferroelectric/J technology/N from/I Krysalis/N Corp./N in/I Albuquerque/N ,/, N.M/N ./.
National/N says/V it/P agreed/V to/T acquire/V Krysalis/N 's/P assets/N and/C will/M start/V shipping/V commercial/J quantities/N of/I its/P first/J chips/N ,/, including/V a/D 4-kilobit/J memory/N ,/, next/J year/N ./.
Once/N production/N hurdles/N are/V overcome/N ,/, the/D chips/N could/M take/V over/I a/D significant/J part/N of/I the/D market/N ./.
In/I addition/N to/T not/R needing/V an/D outside/J power/N source/N ,/, they/P are/V potentially/R cheaper/V to/T make/V because/I they/P require/V fewer/J manufacturing/N steps/N than/I conventional/J chips/N ./.
Military/N buyers/N have/V shown/J interest/N ,/, National/N says/V ,/, because/I ferroelectric/J chips/N resist/V atomic/J radiation/N ./.
And/C while/I today/N 's/P non-volatile/J chips/N --/: such/J as/I electronically/D erasable/J programmable/N read-only/N memory/N chips/N --/: ca/M n't/R be/V used/V in/I a/D computer/N 's/P central/J memory/N because/I they/P ``/` learn/J ''/N data/N slowly/N ,/, ferroelectric/J chips/N accept/V data/N at/I very/D high/J speeds/N ./.

Witnesses/N often/N must/M travel/V long/J distances/N to/T give/V face-to-face/J depositions/N before/I lawyers/N and/C court/N reporters/N ./.
That/D means/N huge/N travel/N bills/N ./.
And/C telephone/N or/C videotape/N depositions/N just/R do/V n't/R match/V physical/J encounters/N ./.
That/D could/J change/N ,/, thanks/N to/T lower/V long-distance/J rates/N and/C cheaper/J electronics/N ./.
Video/N Telecom/N Corp./N ,/, which/W markets/N videoconferencing/N systems/N ,/, is/V working/V with/I court/N reporters/N to/T wire/V a/D nationwide/J network/N to/T allow/V depositions/N by/I live/J television/N ./.

While/I lawyers/N arranged/V individual/J tie-ups/N before/N ,/, the/D formal/J network/N of/I court/N reporters/N should/M make/V things/N easier/N and/C cheaper/N ./.

Japanese/N Reverse/N Tack/N On/I Patent/N Protection/.
JAPAN'S/N MISUSE/N of/I U.S./N patents/N has/V been/V a/D sore/J point/N for/I American/N chip/N makers/N ./.

The/D moves/N illustrate/V the/D more/J aggressive/N attitude/N toward/I patent/N protection/N that/I patent/N experts/N say/V Japan/N is/V starting/V to/T take/V ./.
Hitachi/N made/V the/D reverse-engineering/N charges/N in/I an/D amendment/N to/T a/D counterclaim/N filed/V in/I a/D federal/J district/N court/N in/I Texas/N after/I Motorola/N sued/N Hitachi/N for/I patent/N violation/N ./.

Tandy/N Corp./N ,/, citing/V sluggish/J sales/N of/I consumer-electronics/J goods/N ,/, said/V net/J income/N dropped/V 3.3/J %/N for/I the/D first/J quarter/N ended/V Sept./N 30/C ./.
The/D results/N ,/, which/W represented/V the/D fifth/J consecutive/N quarter/N of/I flat-to-lower/J earnings/N for/I the/D big/J electronics/N retailer/N ,/, disappointed/J analysts/N and/C traders/N ./.

The/D company/N said/V earnings/N would/M have/V increased/V if/I it/P had/V n't/R been/V actively/R repurchasing/V its/P shares/N ,/, thus/R increasing/V its/P interest/N expense/N and/C reducing/N its/P interest/N income/N ./.

Tandy/N said/V consumer/N electronics/N sales/N at/I its/P Radio/N Shack/N stores/N have/V been/V slow/N ,/, partly/N because/I of/I a/D lack/N of/I hot/N ,/, new/J products/N ./.

At/I a/D private/J dinner/N Thursday/N ,/, Drexel/N Burnham/N Lambert/N Inc./N chief/N executive/N Frederick/N Joseph/N delivered/V a/D sobering/J message/N about/I the/D junk/N bond/N market/N to/T officials/N of/I Prudential/N Insurance/N Co./N of/I America/N ./.
Mr./N Joseph/N conceded/V the/D junk/N market/N was/V in/I disarray/N ,/, according/V to/T people/N familiar/N with/I the/D discussion/N ./.
He/P said/V Drexel/N --/: the/D leading/J underwriter/N of/I high-risk/J junk/N bonds/N --/: could/M no/V longer/R afford/V to/T sell/V any/D junk/N offerings/N if/I they/P might/M later/R become/V troubled/V because/I Drexel/N risked/N losing/V its/P highly/V lucrative/J junk/N franchise/N ./.
The/D dinner/N was/V a/D stark/J confirmation/N that/I 1989/N is/V the/D worst/J year/N ever/N for/I the/D $/$ 200/C billion/C junk/N market/N ./.
And/C investors/N and/C traders/N alike/N say/V the/D current/J turmoil/N could/M take/V years/N to/T resolve/V ./.
Amid/I the/D market/N disorder/N ,/, even/N Drexel/N ,/, which/W has/V the/D widest/N and/C most/J loyal/N following/V of/I junk/N bond/N investors/N ,/, is/V pulling/V in/I its/P horns/N ./.
Although/I the/D big/J investment/N bank/N still/R dominates/V the/D junk/N market/N ,/, Drexel/N has/V been/V unable/V to/T stem/V the/D fallout/N from/I growing/N junk/N bond/N defaults/N ,/, withdrawn/V new/J offerings/N ,/, redemptions/N by/I shareholders/N in/I junk/N bond/N mutual/N funds/N and/C an/D exodus/N of/I once-devoted/J investors/N ./.
For/I many/J money/N managers/N ,/, the/D past/N four/C months/N have/V been/V humiliating/N ./.
``/` This/P is/V the/D worst/J shakeout/N ever/N in/I the/D junk/N market/N ,/, and/C it/P could/M take/V years/N before/I it/P 's/V over/R ,/, ''/' says/V Mark/N Bachmann/N ,/, a/D senior/J vice/N president/N at/I Standard/N &/C Poor/N 's/P Corp./N ,/, a/D credit/N rating/N company/N ./.

Since/I the/D end/N of/I last/J year/N ,/, junk/N bonds/N have/V been/V outperformed/V by/I all/D categories/N of/I investment-grade/J bonds/N ,/, including/V ultra-safe/J Treasury/N securities/N ./.

The/D fragile/J market/N received/V its/P biggest/J jolt/N last/J month/N from/I Campeau/N Corp./N ,/, which/W created/V its/P U.S./N retailing/N empire/N with/I more/J than/I $/$ 3/C billion/C in/I junk/N financing/N ./.
Campeau/N developed/V a/D cash/N squeeze/N that/I caused/N it/P to/T be/V tardy/N on/I some/D interest/N payments/N and/C to/T put/V its/P prestigious/J Bloomingdale/N 's/P department/N store/N chain/N up/R for/I sale/N ./.
At/I that/D point/N ,/, the/D junk/N market/N went/V into/I a/D tailspin/N as/I buyers/N disappeared/N and/C investors/N tried/V to/T sell/V ./.
In/I an/D interview/N ,/, Mr./N Joseph/N says/V his/P dinner/N discussion/N with/I the/D Prudential/N executives/N acknowledged/N problems/N for/I junk/N ./.
``/` What/W I/P thought/V I/P was/V saying/V is/V that/I the/D market/N is/V troubled/J but/C still/N viable/N and/C ,/, appropriately/N enough/N ,/, quite/N quality-conscious/N ,/, which/W is/V not/R at/I all/D bad/N ,/, ''/' he/P says/V ./.

And/C as/I it/P unfolds/N ,/, it/P 's/V revealing/J some/N of/I the/D more/J tangled/N and/C seamier/N aspects/N of/I Japanese/J society/N ./.
Already/N ,/, ruling/N Liberal/N Democratic/N Party/N demands/N that/I opposition/N members/N testify/V under/I oath/N in/I parliament/N have/V stalled/N one/C budget/N committee/N session/N and/C forced/V the/D committee/N to/T plan/V a/D special/J two-day/N investigation/N at/I the/D end/N of/I the/D month/N ./.

This/D time/N ,/, the/D scandal/N centers/N on/I donations/N made/V by/I the/D not-quite-mainstream/J pachinko/N parlor/N industry/N ./.
Pachinko/N ,/, a/D kind/N of/I pinball/N ,/, is/V Japan/N 's/P favorite/J form/N of/I legal/J gambling/N ./.

But/C the/D implications/N could/M be/V great/N ./.
Pachinko/N is/V slightly/R on/I the/D shady/J side/N ,/, often/R linked/V to/T the/D lower/J ranks/N of/I Japan/N 's/P underworld/N and/C regularly/N at/I the/D top/N of/I annual/J lists/N of/I tax/N evaders/N ./.

Also/N ,/, about/I 60/C %/N of/I pachinko/N parlor/N owners/N are/V Korean/N ,/, many/J of/I whom/N maintain/V close/J ties/N with/I North/N or/C South/N Korean/N residents/N '/P organizations/N ,/, and/C donations/N by/I such/J foreign/J groups/N are/V illegal/N in/I Japan/N ./.
To/D many/J Japanese/N ,/, pachinko/N is/V benign/N or/C enticingly/N unsavory/N ./.
Garish/N neon/N pachinko/N marquees/N blaze/N from/I the/D main/J streets/N and/C narrow/J alleys/N of/I cities/N and/C towns/N across/I the/D country/N ./.
Devotees/N pass/N hours/N ,/, watching/V the/D lights/N blink/N and/C listening/N to/T the/D metal/N balls/N ping/N ,/, as/I much/J to/T gamble/V as/R to/T get/V a/D little/J time/N to/T be/V anonymous/N ,/, alone/N with/I their/P thoughts/N ./.
At/I 500/C yen/N -LRB-/- $/$ 3.60/C -RRB-/N for/I a/D handful/N of/I balls/N ,/, pachinko/N is/V a/D common/J pastime/N ,/, and/C has/V been/V since/I it/P took/V root/N as/I cheap/J entertainment/N in/I the/D years/N after/I World/N War/N II/N ./.

And/C because/I the/D pachinko/N industry/N is/V regularly/N at/I the/D top/N of/I annual/J lists/N for/I tax/N evasion/N ,/, some/D observers/N estimate/V the/D real/J income/N could/M be/V as/I much/J as/I 20/C trillion/C yen/N ./.
If/I that/D money/N were/V being/V taxed/N ,/, it/P could/M bring/V the/D government/N a/D badly/N needed/V several/J trillion/N yen/N ./.
In/I 1984/N ,/, an/D attempt/N was/V made/V to/T crack/V down/R on/I the/D industry/N with/I tougher/J restrictions/N ./.
Then/N ,/, in/I 1988/C ,/, a/D proposal/N to/T keep/V better/J track/N of/I income/N by/I selling/N prepaid/N cards/N for/I pachinko/N was/V fielded/V in/I parliament/N ./.

In/I August/N ,/, a/D conservative/J weekly/N magazine/N reported/V that/I a/D pachinko/N industry/N organization/N donated/N money/N to/T Japan/N Socialist/N Party/N members/N ./.

The/D Chosen/N Soren/N and/C the/D JSP/N immediately/N denied/V the/D report/N ./.

Within/I a/D matter/N of/I weeks/N ,/, less-conservative/N magazines/N reported/V that/I members/N of/I the/D ruling/J LDP/N had/V received/V much/R larger/J donations/N from/I pachinko/N organizations/N ./.
So/I far/N ,/, though/N ,/, there/R have/V been/V no/D allegations/N that/I the/D contributions/N the/D LDP/N members/N received/V amounted/V to/T bribes/N ./.
Then/I the/D two/C camps/N upped/V the/D ante/N :/N Reports/N that/I Chosen/N Soren/N had/V donated/V directly/R to/T JSP/V members/N were/V rapidly/R countered/V by/I statements/N that/I the/D South/N Korean/N residents/N '/P organization/N had/V long/R been/V donating/V directly/R to/T LDP/V members/N ./.
The/D JSP/N admitted/N Oct./N 13/N that/I its/P members/N received/V about/I eight/C million/C yen/N from/I the/D pachinko/N organization/N ,/, and/C charged/N LDP/N members/N with/I receiving/N 125/N million/C yen/N -LRB-/- $/$ 880,000/C -RRB-/N and/C other/J opposition/N parties/N with/I taking/N about/I 2.5/C million/C yen/N ./.

No/D one/N has/V alleged/V that/I the/D donations/N were/V by/I themselves/P illegal/N ./.
Direct/N donations/N from/I either/N of/I the/D residents/N '/P organizations/N would/M be/V illegal/N because/I the/D groups/N are/V defined/V as/I foreign/J ,/, but/C both/D groups/N deny/N making/V direct/J donations/N ./.
They/P say/V possible/J some/N of/I their/P members/N may/M be/V donating/J privately/N ./.
The/D issue/N is/V further/J complicated/N because/I although/I the/D organizations/N represent/V Korean/J residents/N ,/, those/D residents/N were/V largely/R born/V and/C raised/N in/I Japan/N and/C many/J speak/N only/N Japanese/N ./.
That/I they/P retain/V Korean/J citizenship/N and/C ties/N is/V a/D reflection/N of/I history/N --/: their/P parents/N were/V shipped/V in/I as/I laborers/N during/I the/D decades/N when/N Japan/N occupied/N Korea/N before/I World/N War/N II/N --/: and/C the/D discrimination/N that/I still/N faces/N Koreans/N in/I Japanese/J society/N ./.

However/N ,/, these/D figures/N do/V n't/R seem/V to/T worry/V Thomas/N A./N Durkin/N ,/, an/D economist/N at/I the/D Federal/N Reserve/N Board/N ./.
In/I a/D paper/N presented/N at/I the/D recent/J annual/J meeting/N of/I the/D National/N Association/N of/I Business/N Economists/N in/I San/N Francisco/N ,/, Mr./N Durkin/N comments/N that/I ``/D installment/N credit/N always/N grows/V rapidly/R in/I cyclical/J advances/N ,/, and/C growth/N in/I this/D cycle/N is/V very/R typical/V of/I earlier/J experiences/N ./.

But/C what/N about/I the/D debt/N burden/N ?/.
Mr./N Durkin/N doubts/N that/I ``/` there/R is/V some/D magic/J level/N ''/N at/I which/W the/D ratio/N of/I installment/N debt/N to/T disposable/V income/N ``/N indicates/V economic/J problems/N ./. ''/'

The/D chart/N below/I shows/N why/N -LRB-/N see/V accompanying/J illustration/N --/N WSJ/N Oct./N 23/N ,/, 1989/C -RRB-/N ./.
The/D ratio/N of/I consumer/N installment/N credit/N to/T disposable/V income/N ,/, though/N up/I a/D bit/N ,/, has/V n't/R climbed/V steeply/N ,/, and/C such/J debt/N as/I a/D percent/N of/I household/N assets/N is/V little/J changed/N ./.

He/P notes/N that/I some/D ``/J revolving/N credit-card/N credit/N is/V actually/R convenience/J credit/N ''/N being/V used/V simply/R as/I a/D handy/J way/N of/I paying/N bills/N rather/N than/I a/D handy/J way/N of/I borrowing/N ./.

And/C if/I you/P ``/V consider/V the/D changing/J distribution/N of/I credit/N ,/, ''/' Mr./N Durkin/N says/V ,/, ``/` much/J of/I the/D increase/N in/I debt/N in/I recent/J years/N is/V due/J to/T increasing/V credit/N use/N by/I higher-income/J families/N ,/, ''/' that/W is/V ,/, ``/` those/D probably/J best/J able/N to/T handle/V it/P ./.

China/N could/M exhaust/V its/P foreign-exchange/N reserves/N as/I early/N as/I next/J year/N ,/, a/D Western/J government/N report/N says/V ,/, unless/N imports/N are/V cut/V drastically/V to/T help/V narrow/V the/D balance-of-payments/J deficit/N ./.
According/N to/T the/D report/N ,/, completed/V last/J month/N ,/, if/I China/N 's/P trade/N gap/N continues/V to/T widen/V at/I the/D pace/N seen/V in/I the/D first/J seven/N months/N of/I this/D year/N ,/, the/D reserves/N would/M be/V wiped/V out/I either/N in/I 1990/C or/C 1991/N ./.

The/D $/$ 14/C billion/C of/I reserves/N China/N had/V in/I June/N would/M cover/V just/R that/I much/N ./.
The/D report/N by/I the/D Western/J government/N ,/, which/W declines/V to/T be/V identified/N ,/, concludes/V that/I ``/` a/D near-term/J foreign-exchange/N payment/N problem/N can/M be/V avoided/V only/R if/I import/N growth/N drops/V to/T below/$ 5/C %/N per/I annum/N ./. ''/'
According/N to/T Chinese/V customs/N figures/N ,/, import/N growth/N has/V slowed/V in/I recent/J months/N ,/, dropping/V to/T 16/C %/N in/I July/N and/C 7.1/N %/N in/I August/N from/I the/D year-earlier/J periods/N ,/, compared/V with/I an/D average/J growth/N rate/N of/I 26/C %/N in/I the/D first/J half/N ./.
But/C before/I import/N growth/N slowed/N ,/, China/N 's/P buying/N spree/N in/I the/D first/J half/N already/R had/V taken/V its/P toll/N on/I foreign-exchange/N reserves/N ./.
The/D $/$ 14/C billion/C level/N in/I June/N marked/V a/D drop/N from/I $/$ 19/C billion/C at/I the/D end/N of/I April/N ./.
China/N 's/P last/J big/J import/N binge/N sent/V reserves/N tumbling/V to/T $/$ 10.6/C billion/C in/I June/N 1985/N from/I $/$ 16.6/C billion/C the/D previous/J September/N ./.
China/N might/M stave/V off/I a/D crisis/N if/I it/P acts/N as/I forcefully/N as/I it/P did/V to/T arrest/V the/D 1985/J decline/N ,/, when/W Beijing/V slammed/V the/D brakes/N on/I foreign-exchange/N spending/N and/C devalued/V the/D currency/N ./.
But/C this/D time/N ,/, China/N faces/V a/D more/J difficult/J battle/N because/I of/I economic/J forces/N that/I have/V come/V into/I play/N since/I the/D Tiananmen/N Square/N killings/N June/N 4/N ./.
For/I example/N ,/, China/N 's/P hard-currency/N income/N is/V expected/V to/T suffer/V from/I the/D big/J drop/N in/I tourist/N arrivals/N since/I June/N 4/N ./.

The/D Western/J government/N report/N suggests/V a/D number/N of/I scenarios/N for/I China/N 's/P current-account/J balance/N ,/, two/C of/I which/W are/V considered/V most/J likely/N ./.
In/I one/N ,/, imports/N and/C exports/N continue/V to/T grow/V at/I the/D respective/J average/N rates/N of/I 25/C %/N and/C 5/C %/N recorded/V during/I the/D first/J seven/N months/N ,/, and/C the/D current-account/J deficit/N widens/V to/T $/$ 13.1/C billion/C ./.
In/I 1985/N ,/, China/N had/V a/D record/N deficit/N of/I $/$ 11.4/C billion/C ./.
The/D other/J scenario/N assumes/N that/I Beijing/N takes/V effective/J actions/N to/T curb/V imports/N in/I the/D coming/J months/N ./.
In/I this/D case/N ,/, China/N would/M still/R finish/V the/D year/N with/I a/D current-account/J deficit/N of/I $/$ 8.7/C billion/C ,/, based/V on/I projections/N that/I imports/N for/I all/N of/I this/D year/N grow/N 20/C %/N and/C exports/N 10/C %/N ./.
If/I China/N were/V still/R on/I good/J terms/N with/I foreign/J lenders/N ,/, it/P might/M be/V able/J to/T stem/V the/D drain/N on/I its/P foreign-exchange/N reserves/N by/I using/V some/D loan/N funds/N to/T offset/V the/D current-account/J deficit/N ./.
But/C since/I June/N ,/, foreign/J bankers/N led/V by/I international/J financial/J institutions/N have/V virtually/R suspended/V their/P new/J loans/N to/T China/N ./.
Even/N if/I borrowing/N resumes/N ,/, commercial/J bankers/N are/V n't/R expected/V to/T lend/V as/I much/J as/I before/N ./.
In/I addition/N ,/, economists/N are/V forecasting/V a/D slowdown/N in/I foreign/J direct/N investments/N as/I businessmen/N become/V increasingly/R wary/V of/I China/N 's/P deteriorating/V political/J and/C economic/J environment/N ./.
On/I top/N of/I all/D this/N ,/, foreign-debt/N repayments/N are/V expected/V to/T peak/V in/I 1991/N to/T 1992/V ./.
With/I less/J capital/N coming/V in/I ,/D China/N 's/P balance/N of/I payments/N would/M suffer/V ./.
The/D Western/J government/N report/N 's/P first/J scenario/N assumes/V a/D 30/J %/N reduction/N in/I foreign/J borrowing/N and/C a/D 5/J %/N contraction/N in/I foreign/J direct/N investment/N ./.
In/I the/D second/N ,/, foreign/J borrowing/N is/V projected/V to/T grow/V 10/C %/N and/C investment/N to/T drop/V 10/C %/N ./.
But/C in/I either/D case/N ,/, the/D report/N says/V ,/, China/N 's/P balance/N of/I payments/N would/M rapidly/R dry/V up/R foreign/J reserves/N ,/, which/W are/V used/V to/T finance/V the/D imbalance/N ./.

Texaco/N Inc./N has/V purchased/V an/D oil-producing/J company/N in/I Texas/N for/I $/$ 476.5/C million/C ,/, its/P first/J major/J acquisition/N since/I its/P legal/J brawl/N with/I Pennzoil/N Co./N began/V more/R than/I four/C years/N ago/N ./.
The/D White/N Plains/N ,/, N.Y./N ,/, oil/N company/N said/V Friday/N that/I it/P had/V acquired/V Tana/N Production/N Corp./N ,/, a/D subsidiary/N of/I TRT/N Energy/N Holdings/N Inc./N ,/, for/I $/$ 95.1/C million/C in/I cash/N ,/, with/I the/D rest/N to/T be/V paid/V in/I shares/N of/I a/D new/J ,/, non-voting/N issue/N of/I preferred/J stock/N ./.
Tana/N ,/, which/W holds/V properties/N in/I 17/C oil/N and/C gas/N fields/N in/I south/J Texas/N ,/, will/M provide/V Texaco/N with/I mostly/N gas/N reserves/N ./.
The/D fields/N contain/V recoverable/J reserves/N of/I 435/N billion/C cubic/N feet/N of/I natural/J gas/N and/C four/C million/C barrels/N of/I oil/N ./.
``/` This/D acquisition/N is/V another/D indication/N of/I Texaco/N 's/P commitment/N to/T increase/V the/D company/N 's/P reserve/N base/N ,/, ''/' said/V Chief/J Executive/N Officer/N James/N W./N Kinnear/N ./.
Texaco/N has/V also/R been/V attempting/V to/T sell/V oil/N properties/N ./.
At/I least/J two/C years/N ago/N ,/, the/D company/N put/V 60/C million/C barrels/N of/I oil/N reserves/N on/I the/D block/N ./.
They/P were/V either/R too/R small/J or/C uneconomic/N to/T maintain/V ,/, the/D company/N said/V ./.
Not/N all/N of/I those/D parcels/N have/V yet/R been/V sold/V ./.
Texaco/N acquired/V Tana/N before/I it/P completed/V those/D sales/N because/I Tana/N 's/P properties/N are/V high/J quality/N and/C near/I other/J fields/N Texaco/N already/N owns/N ,/, a/D company/N spokeswoman/N said/V ./.
Texaco/N ,/, like/I many/J other/J oil/N companies/N ,/, has/V been/V struggling/V to/T replace/V its/P falling/V oil/N and/C gas/N reserves/N ./.
Texaco/N 's/P situation/N had/V become/V particularly/R complex/V because/I much/J of/I its/P effort/N had/V for/I years/N been/V focused/V on/I its/P brawl/N with/I Pennzoil/N and/C then/N on/I New/N York/N investor/N Carl/N C./N Icahn/N 's/P attempt/V to/T take/V over/I the/D company/N ./.
Pennzoil/N had/V sued/J Texaco/N for/I improperly/N interfering/N with/I its/P acquisition/N of/I a/D portion/N of/I Getty/N Oil/N Co/N ./.
Eventually/N ,/, Texaco/N ,/, which/W was/V forced/V into/I bankruptcy/N proceedings/N by/I that/D litigation/N ,/, settled/V its/P fight/N with/I Pennzoil/N for/I $/$ 3/C billion/C in/I 1986/N ./.
Mr./N Icahn/N ,/, who/W played/V a/D key/J role/N in/I the/D settlement/N and/C attempted/N subsequently/V to/T take/V control/N of/I the/D company/N ,/, sold/V his/P stake/N in/I Texaco/N just/R last/J summer/N ./.
Completion/N of/I Texaco/N 's/P acquisition/N of/I Tana/N is/V subject/N to/T government/N approval/N under/I the/D Hart-Scott-Rodino/N Antitrust/N Improvements/N Act/N ./.

President/N Bush/N 's/P national/J security/N adviser/N ,/, Lt./N Gen./N Brent/N Scowcroft/N ,/, came/V into/I office/N in/I January/N intent/N on/I making/V the/D NSC/N staff/N leaner/N and/C more/J disciplined/N than/I it/P had/V been/V during/I the/D Reagan/N administration/N ./.
Gen./N Scowcroft/N was/V a/D member/N of/I the/D Tower/N Commission/N ,/, which/W investigated/V the/D Iran-Contra/N affair/N ./.
He/P was/V all/D too/J aware/N of/I how/V a/D large/N ,/, inadequately/N supervised/N NSC/N staff/N had/V spun/V out/R of/I control/N and/C nearly/N wrecked/N President/N Reagan/N 's/P second/J term/N ./.

The/D National/N Security/N Council/N itself/P was/V established/V in/I 1947/N because/I policy/N makers/N sensed/V a/D need/N ,/, in/I an/D increasingly/J complex/J world/N ,/, for/I a/D formal/J system/N within/I the/D White/N House/N to/T make/V sure/J that/I communications/N flowed/N smoothly/N between/I the/D president/N and/C the/D State/N Department/N ,/, Pentagon/N and/C intelligence/N agencies/N ./.
