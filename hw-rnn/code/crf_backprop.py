        """Estimates how fast we are trying to learn, based on the gradient
        of the most recent minibatch.  Call this just before or after an
        optimizer step.  
        
        The return value is the estimated improvement in the training loss per
        training example.  This will tend to decrease over time as the model
        approaches a local minimum and the gradient flattens out.
        
        You may discover that your learning speed goes up if you choose
        hyperparameters that increase the number of parameters in your model,
        since this will typically increase the norm of the gradient. 

        If you are trying to learn too fast and getting poor results, try
        reducing your learning speed by reducing the learning rate (smaller
        updates) or by increasing the minibatch size (less frequent updates).

        Reducing the learning speed can reduce noise in the optimization by
        placing less trust in our two approximations -- that the function is
        locally linear (motivating gradient-based updates) and that individual
        examples are correlated with the batch gradient (motivating stochastic
        updates).
               
        We define learning speed to be lr times the squared norm of the
        minibatch gradient, divided by the size of the minibatch.  This is
        because for small lr, the loss reduction from a step of size lr in any
        direction v will change the loss by about lr * (gradient dot v).  Thus,
        if v is itself the gradient direction, the loss will change by lr *
        (gradient dot gradient) = lr * ||gradient||^2.
        
        Note that the optimizer may not in fact take a step in exactly the
        gradient direction, thanks to techniques such as momentum or weight
        decay."""
